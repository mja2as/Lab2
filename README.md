  I allowed for user input of their latitude/longitude in the closest_wendys.py file, so that the program is functional for any user, anywhere, instaed of just at UVA. I also accidentally committed that change straight to master, instead of to my branch, so I then added an arbitrary line of comment code to do the branch -> pull request -> merge flow correctly
